// Task 1
// Declare two variables: admin and name.
// Assign the value "John" to name.
// Copy the value from name to admin.
// Show the value of admin using alert (must output “John”).
let admin;
let name = 'John';
admin = name;
alert(admin)


// Task 2
// Create a variable with the name of our planet. How would you name such a variable?
// Create a variable to store the name of a current visitor to a website. How would you name that variable?
let ourPlanetName = 'Earth';
let currentVisitor = 'Raisa';

// Task 3 
// My take: birthday should be declared in all caps because it is hard-coded in this example. age should no be in upper case because it will be calculated later.
